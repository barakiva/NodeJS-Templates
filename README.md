# NodeJS Templates

A repository of ready-made code for configuration, tools and setups I don't have the time (i.e. lazy) to re-write. Every branch is a configuration of the basic NodeJS Express setup with a different take. 

This project includes authentication (social, token or credential based), mongodb setup, unit testing using both Mocha and Jest (you'd be suprised at the pain of getting it to work with ES6+ projects), and much more as I keep contributing to Stack Overflows market cap.
